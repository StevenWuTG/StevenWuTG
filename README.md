# Hi there, I'm Steve ðŸ‘‹

Prior to the covid-19 pandemic, I have had the pleasure to manage one of the most renowned ramen restaurant chains in New York City for the past 6 years. Although the pandemic was trialing, it gave me the opportunity to learn coding which has always been a dream of mine. Now as a full stack developer I spend my time working on my projects and learning new technologies.

In my free time I enjoy gaming with friends, hiking and enjoying all the wonderful restaurants the world has to offer.
